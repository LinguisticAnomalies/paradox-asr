# Paradox ASR

This repository contains code developed for the neurIPS ML4H extended poster, The Far Side of Failure: Investigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Subsequent Dementia Classification.

While the data of AD Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS)  and Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) are publicly available, we are not able to redistribute any of these data per Data Use agreement with 
Dementia Bank. Individual investigators need to contact the [Dementia Bank](https://dementia.talkbank.org/) to request access to the data.

## Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to run the scripts. The conda environemnt setup can be found in `environment.yml`. The scripts are developed using Python 3.8.12.


## Folders
- `scripts` contains all scripts.
- `asr-trans` contains utterance-level transcripts generated by ASR models
    - The name convention of the output file follows as `{mode}-{model_name}-{dataset}.csv`, where `mode` indicates if the model is pre-trained or fine-tuned, `model_name` indicates the name of the ASR model, and `dataset` indicates the corresponding dataset for the utterance-level transcripts.
- `ft-models` contains the Pytorch configuration files for the fine-tuned ASR models
